To use samples for development:

1. Create `.active` file here, fill with the name of sample directory (eg., `union-type`)
2. From root directory, run either script:
   - `dev:compile` - watches source files, recompiles sample program
   - `dev:compile-run` - watches source files, recompiles and runs the compiled sample
